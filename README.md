# The Ape Society Amphitheatre Module for Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord

"The Ape Society" is owned by a distributed and decentralized group of owners who collectively own a set of virtual apes with unique characteristics and attributes. These apes are part of a larger digital ecosystem where ownership and transactions are recorded on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. The Ape Society has allowed the developers of the Amphitheatre, a custom module for the game Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord, to utilize the Intellectual Property (IP) associated with these virtual apes.

The module developed for the Amphitheatre serves a specific purpose of authenticating the IP of assets used in competitive matches. It leverages blockchain technology to verify and validate the ownership of apes and their associated gear. By tokenizing the ownership of apes and gear, each player is granted authorization to use the IP associated with a particular ape.

It's important to note that these tokens representing the apes and gear are not "in-game" items in the traditional sense. Instead, they represent the intellectual property of "The Ape Society" itself. In this context, they can be seen as digital assets with unique characteristics and value, much like Anduril (Aragorn's sword) from the Lord of the Rings. These tokens are separate from the game's internal economy and are protected by blockchain technology to ensure their authenticity and ownership.

In addition to the overall Ape Society, a smaller group of members known as "Sponsors" voluntarily opted to allow their apes' intellectual property to be used in conjunction with weapons and armor that community members can equip within the Amphitheatre module. This means that the apes' IP extends to the gear associated with them, and players who possess these tokens have the right to utilize both the apes' and gear's IP.

By integrating blockchain verification and tokenized ownership of apes and gear, the developers of the Amphitheatre module have created a system that allows for the authentication and authorized usage of the intellectual property associated with these virtual assets. This ensures that players can participate in competitive matches using legitimate and authorized IP, similar to how the IP of iconic items in fictional universes like Lord of the Rings is protected and regulated.
